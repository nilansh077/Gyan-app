Gyaan Saarthi App 
"Gyaan Saarthi" is a transformative initiative addressing the knowledge gap in rural India. This app uses a phone camera to scan any document (currently supports only English-language documents) and create a voice assistant bot, and the user can interact with that bot using voice in Hindi. This app helps uneducated people or anyone who lacks understanding of complex documents like bank documents, tax documents, policies documents, etc In the future, we will add support for other languages as well. This app also allows you to build a voice bot on top of a pdf document. You have to submit the pdf, and your voice bot gets ready to ask queries. This app is mainly powered by a GPT model and a vector database.
